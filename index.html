			<h1>Hello, I'm Marine</h1>
			<img src="images/profile-picture.png" width="200" height="200" class="img-circle" alt="Marine Senlis">
			<p>I am a second year student at IESEG School of Management. I was lucky to spend three years in Chicago (during Highschool) which led me to enjoy being abroad to discover new cultures and learn other ways to do certain things. It was (and still is) therefore really important to me to keep learning and discovering new means of working with everyone.
